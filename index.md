Welcome to Laputas!

It is said that the British physicist Lord Kelvin, in the late 1890s, 
proclaimed "There is nothing new to be discovered in physics now. 
All that remains is more and more precise measurement."
Within few decades, quantum mechanics and Einstein's theory of relativity 
had completely revolutionized physics. No physicist today would assert what
Lord Kelvin did more than a century back. In fact, each new discovery seems 
to ask even bigger and deeper questions. 

In this webpage, we aim to cover some of the intricacies and nuances 
associated with many of the facets of physics, 
including some of these unresolved problems. 

We have divided the content in three levels:

You can just read the text
You can look at the code
You can work through the exercises.

Hope youâ€™ll fun working it out!
