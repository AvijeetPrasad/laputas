title: High energy protons
---

Protons have a rest mass equivalent to an energy of around 938 MeV. As the proton is accelerated, due to special relativistic effects, their mass increses. In order to understand the physics at conditions close to the Big Bang, particle accelerators such as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) accelerates protons and and other charged particles close to the speed of light. For example in LHC, protons are accelerted to energies of 7 TeV, i.e. ~7000 times their rest mass. Due to this increase in their mass/energy their behaviour in a gravitational field will be modified. Here we study these effects as the proton's velocity the speed of light.
