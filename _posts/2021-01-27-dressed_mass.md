title: Dressed mass and singularity

---

In classical theories, as the size of the particle tends to zero, the energies associated with the particle approached infinity.
Here we look at how interaction can "dress" a particle giving a total mass different than its bare mass. As a consequence, 
we see that the size of the particle becoming zero does not cause its mass to become infinite. The Mach's principle takes
into account interactions of all the particles in the universe to give the inertial mass.
Using this idea, we can estimate the values of the interaction cross-sections of strong, weak, and electromagnetic forces.
